/* 
1. array.length (for length of the array)
2.array.push() (for adding element to array at the last,like append in python for list;if you assign a variable to it you can return it)
3. array.pop() (removes the last element from the array ; if you assing a varible to it , you can return it  )
4. typeof (ex: typeof 25,output is number)
5.alert() (gives allert on webpage)


TYPES IN JA (CHECK IN GOOGLE)
string and number will be same as python ; bool will be complete small letters(true,false);
object={};
symbol=symbol();
check complex number and there are 8 types

for loop in js, there are different types of for loop in js
1.for (iterator; condition; iteration) {
  logic;
}
2.for..of loop
for (const value of iterable) {

}
compare with python 
for i in range x:
here value=i and x=iterable

varable.repeat()

creation of function
function x(y){}
x(z) (you should call the function like python)
x is function,y is variable

in python str+num raises error ,
but in js str + num gives strnum, it converts num to str
"nst"+27=nst27
"47"-37=10 it converts to num
"nst"-20 = NaN (means error)

72 is decimal
072 is octal
0101b if b is there in last then it is binary
// oxAB9 starting ox is there then it is 
learn about complex num

round 
Math.round() it rounds
Math.ceil()  it take nearst next int
Math.floor()  it take nearest previous int

random number
Math.random()
Math.floor(Math.random()*6)+1  // it starts from 1 to 6, 1 and 6 are included , and Math.floor helps to get integer
Math.ceil(Math.random()) // it also gives integer 
Math.round(Math.random()) // it also gives int
// check diif b/t these numbers

js f-strings
let x="pranav";
let y=`${x} hi`  // use backticks (`)
y= pranav hi

see string methods in js
string.includes()

diff b/w null and undifine
undifine is default value gives by js
null is gives by us

ex:
let x;
console.log(x) // it prints undifine

let x=null
console.log(x) // it prints null

falsy values and truthy values
check w3 schools,js type conversion table

typeof // check these inbuilt function

check operators in w3 schools
ARITHMETICS OPERATORS
COMERASION OPERATORS (===,==,=,!=,!==)
TYPE CONVERSION CHART
LOGICAL OPERATORS (&&,\\,!)
bitwise operators

typeof null is object (it is error when created)
typeof undfined is undfined 

getName() // used for get local variable to outside
